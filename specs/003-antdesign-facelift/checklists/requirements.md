# Specification Quality Checklist: AntDesign UI Facelift

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-11-26  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Resolution**: The CDN vs NPM clarification marker was resolved during the planning phase. Research (research.md) determined that AntDesign requires React runtime, which violates Constitutional Principle I (static-first architecture). The feature pivoted to Shoelace UI (Web Components via CDN), documented in the spec.md Clarifications section.

**Status**: All clarifications complete. Feature ready for implementation.
